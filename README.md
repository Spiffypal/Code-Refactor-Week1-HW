About assignment:

This is the first weeks homework for the UNCC Full Stack Flex bootcamp.
We were asked to make the webpage "Web Accessible" and following this: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_accessibility.asp


Steps taken to "fix" the website:
1) Fixed the link to drop to the section for Search Engine Optimization.
2) Cleaned all code in the HTML file to please the eye. I.E - wrapping text properly with tags etc.
3) Combined multiple css properties that had the same credentials.
4) Added alt tags to the photos and links.
5) Added necessary comments to the sections of code in the html file specifying what they were.
6) Added a CSS reset.
